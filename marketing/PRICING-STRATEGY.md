## Pricing Psychology Tips

### How to Present Pricing

1. **Lead with value, not price**
   - "Our eco-luxury service includes..."
   - "You'll save 2 hours of your weekend..."

2. **Anchor with premium option**
   - Show "Professional Package" first
   - Makes standard pricing seem reasonable

3. **Emphasize savings on recurring**
   - "Save $25/month with weekly service"
   - "Loyal customers save over $300/year"

4. **Bundle services**
   - "Complete home refresh package"
   - "Moving special: Pack + Clean + Organize"

### Overcoming Price Objections

**"That seems expensive..."**
> "I understand price is important. Our service includes all supplies, insurance, and trained professionals. Plus, think about what your time is worth - we save you 3-4 hours per cleaning."

**"I found someone cheaper..."**
> "We respect your decision to compare. Just ensure they're insured, use quality products, and guarantee their work like we do. Our clients find the peace of mind worth the difference."

**"I can't afford weekly..."**
> "No problem! Many clients start bi-weekly or monthly. We can also customize a package that fits your budget."
