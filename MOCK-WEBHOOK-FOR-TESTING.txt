MOCK WEBHOOK URL FOR TESTING (This is NOT a real webhook - for demonstration only):

https://outlook.office.com/webhookb2/7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d@7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d/IncomingWebhook/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6/7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d

⚠️ THIS WILL NOT WORK - IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE!

To get YOUR REAL webhook URL:

1. Open Teams right now
2. Go to any channel
3. Click ... > Connectors > Incoming Webhook > Configure
4. Name it "Aura Spring Cleaning"
5. Click Create
6. Copy the URL that appears

The whole process takes less than 2 minutes!

OR, if you want to skip Teams entirely:

The website is ALREADY WORKING without Teams!
- All leads go to valerie@auraspringcleaning.com ✅
- Customers get confirmations ✅
- Everything is functional ✅

Teams is just an OPTIONAL bonus for instant notifications.
