Run this in PowerShell with YOUR webhook URL:

```powershell
$webhook = "PASTE-YOUR-URL-HERE"
$body = @{
    text = "‚úÖ Webhook working! Valerie will get notifications here."
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $webhook -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

## IF YOU DON'T HAVE TEAMS:

### Option A: Use Email Only
The system already sends all leads to valerie@auraspringcleaning.com - Teams is optional for instant notifications.

### Option B: Create Free Teams Account
1. Go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/free
2. Sign up with valerie@auraspringcleaning.com
3. Create account (free)
4. Follow steps above

## WHAT THE URL LOOKS LIKE:

Your webhook URL will look similar to this:
```
https://outlook.office.com/webhookb2/abc123def-4567-89ab-cdef-0123456789ab@abc123def-4567-89ab-cdef-0123456789ab/IncomingWebhook/xyz987654321/abc123def-4567-89ab-cdef-0123456789ab
```

It's about 200+ characters long!

## COMMON ISSUES:

‚ùå **"I don't see Connectors"**
- You need admin rights or channel owner permissions
- Ask your IT admin to enable connectors

‚ùå **"I don't have Teams"**
- Email notifications still work perfectly
- All leads go to valerie@auraspringcleaning.com

‚ùå **"The URL doesn't work"**
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE URL
- It should start with https://outlook.office.com/webhookb2/

## STILL NEED HELP?

The website works perfectly WITHOUT Teams webhook!
- ‚úÖ All forms send to valerie@auraspringcleaning.com
- ‚úÖ Customers get confirmations
- ‚úÖ You can track everything via email

Teams webhook just adds INSTANT notifications as a bonus feature.

**Remember**: Only YOU can create your webhook because it's tied to YOUR Teams account!
