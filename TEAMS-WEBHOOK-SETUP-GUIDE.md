```

## Webhook URL Format

Your webhook URL should look like this:
```
https://outlook.office.com/webhookb2/[GUID]@[GUID]/IncomingWebhook/[ID]/[GUID]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the webhook doesn't work:
1. **Check the URL**: Make sure you copied the entire URL
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure you have rights to add connectors
3. **Check the channel**: Make sure the channel is active
4. **Test manually**: Try the test script

### Common Issues:
- **"401 Unauthorized"**: The webhook URL is incorrect
- **"400 Bad Request"**: The message format is wrong (shouldn't happen with our scripts)
- **No notification appears**: Check Teams notification settings

## Manual Test (Without Script)

You can test your webhook URL directly with this PowerShell command:
```powershell
$webhookUrl = "YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL-HERE"
$body = @{
    "@type" = "MessageCard"
    "@context" = "https://schema.org/extensions"
    "themeColor" = "7c9768"
    "summary" = "Test Message"
    "sections" = @(
        @{
            "activityTitle" = "âœ… Webhook Test Successful!"
            "activitySubtitle" = "Aura Spring Cleaning"
            "text" = "Your Teams webhook is working! Valerie will receive all lead notifications here."
            "facts" = @(
                @{ "name" = "Contact"; "value" = "Valerie - (512) 781-0527" }
            )
        }
    )
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $webhookUrl -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```
