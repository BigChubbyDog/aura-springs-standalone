# Headshot Image Instructions

## Required Images

Please add the following images to this directory (`public/images/`):

1. **dustin-headshot.jpg**
   - Professional headshot of Dustin Allan
   - Recommended size: 800x800px (square)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File name must be exactly: `dustin-headshot.jpg`

2. **valerie-headshot.jpg**
   - Professional headshot of Valerie Boatman
   - Recommended size: 800x800px (square)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File name must be exactly: `valerie-headshot.jpg`

## Current Setup

The About page (`/about`) is configured to display these images with:
- Large prominent Aura Spring Cleaning logo at the top
- Founder headshots in the "Meet Your Time Creators" section
- Professional layout with gradient overlays

## Temporary Solution

Until the actual headshots are added, the page will show broken image placeholders. Once you add the files with the exact names above, they will automatically appear on the About page.

## Image Optimization Tips

- Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
- Use JPG format for photographs
- Ensure good lighting and professional appearance
- Square aspect ratio works best with the current design
