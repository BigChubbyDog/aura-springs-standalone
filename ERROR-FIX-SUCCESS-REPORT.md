## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (COMPLETED)

### 1. ‚úÖ localStorage Error - FIXED

- Component now works correctly on both server and client
**Result:** No more "localStorage is not defined" errors!

**Solution:** Converted to new `remotePatterns` format with proper protocol and pathname
**Result:** Image configuration warning resolved

**Solution:** Created comprehensive `.env.local` file with all necessary variables
